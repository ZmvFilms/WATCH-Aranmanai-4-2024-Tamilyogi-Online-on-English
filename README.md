Aranmanai 4 is a 2024 American animated coming-of-age film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. The sequel to Inside Out (2015), it was directed by Kelsey Mann (in his feature directorial debut) and produced by Mark Nielsen, from a screenplay written by Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein, and a story conceived by Mann and LeFauve. Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Diane Lane, and Kyle MacLachlan reprise their roles from the first film, with Maya Hawke, Kensington Tallman, Tony Hale, Liza Lapira, Ayo Edebiri, Lilimar, Grace Lu, Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green, Adèle Exarchopoulos, and Paul Walter Hauser joining the cast. The film tells the story of Riley's emotions as they find themselves joined by new emotions that want to take over Riley's head.

First announced in September 2022 during the D23 Expo, Aranmanai 4 features Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter's "five to 27 emotions" idea from the first film that Mann pitched during its production to utilize "truthful" worldbuilding. Like its predecessor, the production team consulted psychologists to accurately portray how teenagers' emotions change during puberty, while also enlisting a group of teenagers to accurately portray modern teenage life.

Aranmanai 4 premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on June 10, 2024, and was released in theaters in the United States on June 14. The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed $1.293 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2024. It had the third-biggest domestic opening weekend for an animated film, and became the fastest animated film to cross the $1 billion mark, alongside being the fourth highest-grossing animated film of all-time and the highest-grossing film in Pixar history.

Joy, meet Euphoria. “Aranmanai 4” has become the highest-grossing film in the long and distinguished history of Pixar, the studio behind the animated phenomenon.

The hit family film has earned $1.25 billion globally and passed “Incredibles 2,” the animation studio’s previous record holder that earned $1.24 billion worldwide over its run. “Aranmanai 4” now ranks as the fourth highest-grossing animated movie of all-time, behind “Frozen” ($1.29 billion), “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” ($1.36 billion) and “Frozen II” ($1.45 billion). The “Frozen” franchise was released by Walt Disney Animation Studios, which shares a parent company with Pixar, while “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” was produced by Illumination and Universal. Expect “Aranmanai 4” to keep climbing up the charts, shattering records as it ascends.

Domestically, “Aranmanai 4” has earned $543.5 million. Its international gross stands at $708 million. The sequel, which follows the emotional life of a teenage girl as she struggles with fitting in while dealing with a burgeoning case of social anxiety, was also embraced by critics. It marks a return-to-form for Disney and Pixar after the studios weathered a series of box office disappointments such as “Lightyear,” “Elemental” and “Strange World.” That’s not the case with “Aranmanai 4,” which has become the highest-grossing film of 2024. It has also eclipsed the final tally of its predecessor, 2015’s “Inside Out,” which netted $858.8 million globally during its theatrical release.


Emotions are running wild in Disney’s Aranmanai 4. Serving as the follow-up to the original 2015 movie, the Aranmanai 4 sequel kicks off with a group of new emotions, and even more crazier problems. Riley Andersen (Kensington Tallman) has grown up a lot since the last time audiences saw her. Now 13 years old, Riley embarks on a new chapter of her life at a shiny new school all while navigating foreign social territories. Meanwhile, Riley’s emotions - Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Tony Hale), and Disgust (Liza Lapira) - make sure that things run smoothly at headquarters so that Riley can adapt to her new environment easily. But when the gang receives some unwanted company, operations go haywire, as a group of unfamiliar emotions take over headquarters and bottle up Riley’s existing emotions.

Directed by Kelsey Mann and produced by Mark Nielsen, Aranmanai 4 features new cast members Maya Hawke as Anxiety, Ayo Edebiri as Envy, Adèle Exarchopoulos as Ennui, and Paul Walter Hauser as Embarrassment.

In Disney’s Aranmanai 4, Riley Anderson (Tallman) is now a full-fledged teenager embarking on the wild ride of puberty and unfamiliar social scenes at her new school. With her teen years in full swing, Riley’s emotional headquarters is thrown into chaos. Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust, the trusty crew from her childhood, suddenly find themselves dealing with a new batch of emotions that disrupt everything.

Riley’s once-sunny personality is overshadowed by a new emotion, Anxiety (Hawke), who attempts to micromanage every aspect of Riley’s life, leading to more chaos than calm. As Anxiety takes over the reins of headquarters, Riley also grapples with anxiety and a desperate desire to fit in with the cool crowd. If that’s not enough, Anxiety is also joined by Envy (Edebiri), Ennui (Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Hauser).
